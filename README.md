## Overview
I've made this repo public so that it might help others learn from how it is put together. And better yet, maybe someone will let me know about things that could be improved (though I have a list of improvements to make already). Please feel free to download the code or fork it for your own spelunking, but please don't copy it wholesale as if you built it.

The site is built on Stacey (<http://staceyapp.com>). This is a great little CMS that doesn't require a backend database. All of the content and assets are stored in directories. It's a perfect system for lightweight portfolio sites.

## Notable Features

A few of the things you may or may not find nifty:

* Pseudo-parallax effect for the background while scrolling.
* Animated contact form (3D transform for flipping the form in WebKit)

## To-Dos

* Add HTML5 History API for portfolio navigation (see <http://html5demos.com/history>)
* Create mobile version.
* Refactor giant JS functions
