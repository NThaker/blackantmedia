description: LegalPM (since renamed Onit) is a project management and collaboration tool for lawyers. Users are able to organize their legal cases, track documents and tasks, and watch budgets. I designed and built the screens for this previous version of the application including a simplified navigation/search bar, overhauled dashboard, and project detail page.
