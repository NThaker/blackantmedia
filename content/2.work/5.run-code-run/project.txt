description: Run Code Run was a hosted continuous integration product <a href='http://thinkrelevance.com'>Relevance</a> built and operated but decided to shut down recently. Before that decision, they asked me to put together some concepts for a possible redesign. These screens show some of these ideas: the build state (pass/fail) of the user's projects, dashboard overview, and project detail page.
