description: Security Ninjas is an interesting site that allows people responsible for websites to hire an expert to perform security audits. They maintain relationships with many high-caliber security experts and audits can be basic or in-depth depending on budgets and timeframes. I designed and built the initial templates for the site, including dashboard, project activity, and project creation pages.
